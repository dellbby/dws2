	Phantogram (formerly Charlie Everywhere) is an American electronic rock duo from Greenwich,
	New York, formed in 2007 and consisting of <b>Josh Carter</b> (vocals, guitars) and <b>Sarah Barthel</b>
	(vocals, keyboards). The band name was inspired by an optical illusion called a phantogram,
	in which two-dimensional images appear to be three-dimensional.They described their sound
	as "street beat, psych pop". According to Josh Carter, their music has "lots of rhythms, 
	swirling guitars, spacey keyboards, echoes, airy vocals". </p>
	<p>
	Carter and Barthel were inspired by artists including: The Beatles, David Bowie, 
	Cocteau Twins, J Dilla, The Flaming Lips, John Frusciante, Serge Gainsbourg, Madlib, Sonic Youth, Yes, Kevin Shields and Prince.</p>
	<p>
	They write and record in a remote barn in upstate New York called Harmony Lodge.
	The band has released two studio albums (Eyelid Movies in 2009, Voices in 2014), 
	four EPs (Phantogram and Running From the Cops in 2009, Nightlife in 2011, 
	Phantogram in 2013) and eight singles.</p>
