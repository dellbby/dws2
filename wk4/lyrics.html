<h2>Lyrics</h2>
	<b>Black Out Days:</b><p>
	Hide the sun
	I will leave your face out of my mind
	You should save your eyes
	A thousand voices howling in my head
	Speak in tongues
	I don’t even recognize your face
	Mirror on the wall
	Tell me all the ways to stay away
	Ey ey ey ah
	Away ey ah
	Away ey ah
	And stay
	Away ey ah
	Away ey ah
	Away ey ah
	Dig a hole
	Fireworks exploding in my hands
	If I could paint the sky
	Would all the stars be shining bloody red?
	Stay
	Ey ey ey ah
	Away ey ah
	Away ey ah
	And stay
	Ey ey ey ah
	Away ey ah
	Away ey ah
	And stay (I'm hearing voices all the time up in my mind)
	Away ey ah
	Away ey ah
	Away ey ah (I'm hearing voices and they're haunting my mind)
	And stay (I'm hearing voices all the time up in my mind)
	Away ey ah
	Away ey ah
	Away ey ah (I'm hearing voices and they're haunting my mind)
	Black out days
	I don’t recognize you anymore.

	<b>The day you died:</b><p>
		Ooh ay hey
		What would I do if I didn't affect you?
		Mary goin' round and round and round
		Tell me the truth, I know that you're leaving.
		Tell me the truth, I know it's you.
		Strange it didn't affect me.
		Strange it didn't affect me.
		Ooh, stay.
		Assuming to your heart, we got nothing at all.
		What should I do?
		It completely destroyed you.
		Swimming around, around and drown. Oh.
		Tell me the truth love.
		I know that you need me.
		Tell me the truth, I know it's you.
		Strange it didn't affect me.
		Strange it didn't affect me.
		I came to say goodbye, cause you're feeling nothing.
		Assuming to your heart, we got nothing at all.
		Cause even if you wanna try to see if there's something.
		I drove into your heart, we got nothing at all.
		Ooh, I...
		I came to say goodbye, cause you're feeling nothing.
		Assuming to your heart, we got nothing at all.
		Cause even if you wanna try to see if there's something.
		I drove into your heart, we got nothing at all.

		And I don't care to say goodbye, cause you're feeling nothing.
		I dug into your heart, we got nothing at all.</p>

		<b>16 Years</b><p>
			16 year in a private ghost chain
			But I know that the miracle changed 
			Summertime is a whirlwind away
			And I know that the lights won't invade
			16 years of mechanical joy
			And I know that the lines show the way
			Burn a candle for magical days
			Now I know that the rest is okay

			It's shooting light AND I'm feeling again
			Is this love that I'm feeling again

			16 years of mechanical joy
			And I know that the lines show the way
			Burn a candle for magical days
			Now I know that the rest is okay

			It's shooting light AND I'm feeling again
			Is this love that I'm feeling again</p>
